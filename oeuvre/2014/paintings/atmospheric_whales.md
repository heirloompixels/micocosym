## Atmospheric Whales

Whales escape for a moment their sublime watery world and take to the air. Naturally aerodynimic from a live spent living in the water universe they swim through our atmosphere talking to birds, crashing through puffy clouds until they plunge with a gold metalists aplomb into the ocean.

Parachutes are wonder.

We live in a world where you can fly 10,000 feet up up up in the sky and jump out of an airplane and not die. For fun.  For the cost of a pair of shoes.    

Just think about that.
