## Whale + Sequoia 

{% myImage "./grfx/paintings/whale_sequoia.jpg" "Whale + Sequoia: In progress, about two layers from the end." %}

In progress.  

This spring I have made a small little world of sea creatures carrying off flora to some distant and most likely extrememly magical secret middle of the ocean type spot.

Here a whale is pulling a Giant Sequoia.
