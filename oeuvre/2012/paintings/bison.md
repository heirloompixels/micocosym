## Bison

Beings of light and energy.  Shadows of night, light of the morning.  We run and run and run towards the horizon seeking out new types of wonder and understanding.  What is around that corner? Where are we going?  These questions and urges so inante in our DNA we just HAVE to know what is up ahead and run headlong towards the future to figure that out.
