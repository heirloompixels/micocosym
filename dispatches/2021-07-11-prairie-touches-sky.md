The great prairie of Wyoming; the land of my birth. 

Endless hills and ravines covered in wavering grasslands. Expanse beyond all which is imaginable. Endless life unfolding a flower holding a bird and a rivulet of water quenching an ecosystem.  

The prairie is not all flat though our imaginations would have us belive otherwise.  Often the void reaches up to touch the sky wanting to experience that other dimensin of limitlessness.  

On these occasions the outcroppings are always dramatic.  Wind swept for millenium these teeth jut out in strange directions sculpted in myriad forms by the hand of the artist nature.  Balanced precariously upon the endless plains of the prairie the relief is unreal and challenges the mind to understand the future.  

The expanses of the great praire is as old as could be imagined.  Once a vast shallow ocean the ancient life is visible everywere in folds and pockets of the past.  More recent is the history of life before the colonists, rock worked by skilled hands to provide life.  This place had a imaginative and very real existence before a genocide wiped that memory away.  

Now the prairie is overworked and robbed of it's treasures but it knows time in a way our human minds are only able to pretend to grasp and one day all will return to an ocean of supple green grasses.
