Far away places. Dark corners of the mountains. Mysteriously bending rivers. Maps whose contour lines are as enchanting as a bar of gold. There is always that wonder inside of me as to what is around the next corner.

Jeannie and I wander incessantly. It fuels our minds and at it’s core is what our relationship is about – the ability to fluidly traverse this world together.

Our adventures fuel our art and inform everything we do; if you want to know more about our art then you must also get to know our adventures. 

I have much to write and document about our adventures, but for a perfectly immediate fix I would suggest you visit [https://intentionallyconfusing.com](https://intentionallyconfusing.com). Jeannie and I launched this new project in the spring of 2021 as a way to document and forment creativity around art and adventure.
