# Unused painting writting



The paintings float in from no where leaving quietly in kind. Some of them torment me and some simply fall from the tip of the brush effortlessly – evening rain on the banana leaf. I am unable to really say where they come from, at least not exactly. Nor do they have a particular purpose. Though when looking at them you will see something and that is what I offer: the space around the edges where familiarity resides kneaded with the mysterious unknown.



## Live Painting

There is a certain magic involved in painting and it is the experience of realizing a painting, the point when it comes into the world as its own thing. This moment is when a piece goes from my hands of control to its own. I make it to a point but then I’m just responsible for finishing what it has become.

I love to bring this experience out from the cobwebbed studio to the broad daylight for all to see and experience and participate in this small piece of wizardry.


I am primarily a painter in oil.  

Currently my painting is focused on the coming problems with our earth's climate.  I'm exploring the inevitable triumpth of nature over adveristy, adaptation and creativity.  The world I situate this investigation is in a existence where animals use human technology to save themselves and others.  These paintings are absurd intentionally, because what we are doing as humans is completely absurd as well.  In this world the creatures save each other instead of only questing for profit.

There is a second explantion of these paintings as well.  In this one I'll tell you that I believe nature as a whole includes us.  In this world nature is using humans to create amazing technology which then is transfered to other creatures.  Now birds wear space helmets and whales tow Giant Sequoia trees. Creatures, or, all of nature is learning from what we humans are creating, it is not our knowledge instead it is the knowledge of nature.
