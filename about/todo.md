Plans and projects for this website.  At times you will find TODO inscribed on the various pages of this site.  These will generally correspond to items in this list, though, not always.  I add the TODO as a note to myself on what I need to keep working on. I hid these TODO notes for a long time.  Their absense now I find to be distracting and so I'm adding them back into the pages, publicy visible so as to be transparent on what I'm doing and where I'm going.  I hope having little TODO notes will also inspire a revisit to see if I've followed up. (TODO: rewrite this paragraph)

TLDR; I'm not perfect and mainting my website is pretty low on my list of priorities so sometimes I settle for less than perfect and leave a note to let you know I know that spot is not perfect and maybe needs some future attention.

(this is an unordered list)

- add projects page
- archive all work in to the Oeuvre
- rewrite TODO page desctiption
