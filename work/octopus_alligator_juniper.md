{% myImage "./grfx/paintings/whale_sequoia.jpg" "Whale + Sequoia: In progress, about two layers from the end." %}

Octopus tenderly tugging a coracle boat which has been planted with a magnificent Alligator Juniper tree.  The tree is stressed but alive and I'm assured will make it just fine in it's new home some where out there in the mysterious middle of the ocean paradise these exsquisite spcimens are being gathered. 

I'm quite fond of the way the arm and boat and tilt of the boat are coming along with this painting.
