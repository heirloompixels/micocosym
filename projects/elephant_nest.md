## Elephant Nest

Since 2011 Jeannie Ortiz and I have been creating an artists habitat in sunny Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. All aspects of what it takes to live in new millenium USA have been explored â€“ from housing to food production. We started out answering the question of how to arrange our life in order to produce art. We walked away with a worldwide community.
