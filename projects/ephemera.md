Our tenacity for exploration is technologically enabled: the wheel gave us carts so we didn’t have to carry all our provisions; math turned the stars into geophysical reference points, opening the oceans. The culmination of the industrial revolution’s advances begot space age technology unlocking the heavens to humankind for an after dinner stroll.  Advances in technology are always met abreast with our desire to see what is around the next corner to know the unknown and return with tales magnificent.  

Vessels of space exploration are not only marvels of engineering but also aesthetic wonders used for but mere moments; they capture our imagination in the way that fire does (fire is still mesmerizing). Space age ephemera now litters our country’s museum or floats in zen like peace in the celestial spheres.  The Opportunity rover still dreams of electric sheep in the red dust of Mars. We all gaze at the moon in awe of the knowledge that we collective visited that dusty orb and left arguable the raddest golf cart every created.  

Technolog, though, is not enough to open areas on the map labeled “here be dragons”.  An absolute, almost blind trust in the world and knowledge of one’s fellow human is requisite before one is to step upon the nose of a 36 story tall rocket filled with somewhere close to a million gallons of jet fuel and oxidizer and press “go”.  It took the same courage to cast off the lines of a caravan class ship and set the sails for the west - trusting there was not just a giant waterfall at the edge of the earth. As we ogle and gawk at the shiny contraptions we have used to prod the void surrounding our nice earth ball the penultimate take away is remembering that as humans our greatest technology is our ability to work together.  


## INTAGLIO PRINTMAKING 

All prints are intaglio drypoint prints; each print is hand pulled on a 100 year old etching press.  Plates are scratched with a scribe point, inked, wiped clean leaving ink deposited in the scratches.  The plate with a piece of paper on it is then rolled through the press where an extraordinary amount of pressure pushes the wet paper into the incised lines in the plate transferrying the ink collected herein and creating the print.  The prints are then dried and pressed flat.  
Watercolor paint is brushed by hand onto each print - making each print a unique piece of art.
