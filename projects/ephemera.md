## Ephemera

Our existence on earth is but the blink of an eye. Our individual thoughts are the wings of a butterfly â€“ they never really happened, but yet, they did. Ephemera is an exploration of these fleeting creations in my mind. Through constant recording of the imagery that appears in front of me I might in the long term begin to understand the modulations of the way my mind thinks.
