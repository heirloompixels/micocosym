At some point when [Jeannie](https://jeannieortiz.com) and I are both old we will take the magical art we've collected over the years, the art we've made and kept for ourselves and all our various treasures (packed and bundled exquisitely) and hide this stash in an innocuous cave deep in the Gila.  We will seal this cave carefully and leave this last art project to the fancy of existence.  Eventually this too will be noticed again, celebrated and wondered upon; maybe by a humanoid marveling at the fat cache or a microbe marveling at all the food.
